# Summary

This is the attempt to clone the original **_[John Smilga's Backroads - HTML](https://github.com/john-smilga/react-course-v3/tree/main/02-backroads-project/backroads-html)_** project. His **_[project](https://github.com/john-smilga/react-course-v3/tree/main/02-backroads-project/backroads-html)_** is styled with vanilla CSS. But I've tried to clone the project styling with **_[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)_** instead of vanilla CSS.

# How to Install

First of all you already have to have node package module installed in you system. You can install node package module from **_[here](https://nodejs.org/en)_**. Then you need to **_clone_** or **_download zip_** file from **_[this link](https://github.com/mszaman/backroads-twcss)_**. Then go to project's root directory and open CLI to install the required package by running the command below.

```shell
npm install
```

After the successful completion of the command above, you need to run the command below to open the project in dev server.

```shell
npm run dev
```

That's it. Now you can modify the project as you want.
